EcoRide – Bike Rental Simulator

This project was part of a group activity where we had to create a simple bike rental simulator in Python. 
Everything had to run in the terminal, so we worked with basic tools like variables, conditionals, loops, and input validation.

The idea was to simulate how a service like EcoRide would work. The user can choose a bike, enter the time of use, 
select a payment method, and the program calculates the total cost, including discounts, penalties, and weekend fees.

We also added a menu so the user can check the rates, make payments, or start a new rental. 
The whole program runs inside a loop, allowing the user to repeat the process as needed.

This project helped us understand how to structure the logic of a program, manage the flow correctly, and validate information so the user doesn't break the system. 
It also gave us practice writing clear interactions inside the console.

At the end of the activity, our TL recommended avoiding the use of while True in real projects because it can cause performance issues if it's not controlled properly.
